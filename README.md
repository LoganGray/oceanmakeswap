# oceanmakeswap
this bash script makes a 1G Swap file on a ubuntu server - due to Digital Oceans absence 

I found a number of problems with Digital Ocean servers randomly killing MySQL and such.
Often I believe this is due to their absence of a swap file on their ubuntu boxes.
I wanted to make something nice and very user friendly to run to add a 1 Gig swap file easy.
